		<p> My tennis career started when I was 7 years old and never have stopped. I was playing mostly tournamennts in Russia and did not have an opportunity to travel outside of Russia. Luckily, I went to Greece where I was noticed by a coach from Arizona State University. That tournament helped me to get into college tennis team that leaded to a fact that I transferred after just one semester to University of Wisconsin, Madison, where nowadays I am playing for the team and very happy to be.</p>
