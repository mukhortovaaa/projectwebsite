		<p>The main major that I decided to get is Consumer Science and Marketplace Studies at The School of Human Ecology. I feel like this major is something that I can be very good at and it is something that interest me a lot.</p>

		<p> The second major is going to be received is Information Science. This is a new major at University of Wisconsin and not well known but I really think it will benefit me a lot in the way of being ahead of other workers.</p>
